<p>Above are prototypes of antenna devices that were created during the work in North America. Some of them, active antennas
(i.e., antennas containing an amplifier), were launched into mass production and implemented in vehicles produced by car 
manufacturers Chrysler and General Motors. The design of others served as a trigger for the production of antennas released 
by other companies.
